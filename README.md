# Cellular Automaton Traffic Simulation

A primarily one-dimensional cellular automaton for traffic simulation based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg model. (See: [Nagel-Schreckenberg model (Wikipedia/DE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg_model), [Nagel-Schreckenberg-Modell (Wikipedia/DE)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagel-Schreckenberg-Modell))

## Installation & Setup

### Simulator

The simulator is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and can be compiled and run using Rust's package manager `cargo`.

```sh
# Run the simulator and show the usage
cargo run -- -h

# Build the simulator binary to use without cargo
cargo build --release
# Run the release binary and show the usage
target/release/cellular-automaton-traffic-simulation -h
```

### Benchmark Tools

The benchmarking tools are written in Python, mainly to take advantage of matplotlib.
You'll need to have Python3 (`>=3.11`), as well as matplotlib and numpy installed on your system.

```sh
# Quickly install requirements
pip install -r benchmarks/requirements.txt
```

__Note:__ The benchmarking tools can run the simulator through cargo or directly.
The default is running the release binary directly, howevery, you'll need to compile it first using
`cargo build --release`. Directly running the release binary is recommended as its faster and
doesn't print every time like cargo does. If you'd like to run the simulator through cargo, go to
benchmarks/adapter.py:6 and change the comment.

## Usage

### Simulator

Every constant used in the simulation has a reasonable default value but can also be manually changed
when running the simulator from the command line (see usage below).

The simulator can print the details of each round to stdout using the `-v` (verbose) switch and/or
generate an image using the `-i` (image) switch.
__Note:__ In image mode cars are represented as pixels ranging from red (stopped) to green (max_speed).
Each row represents a round. The image is read from the bottom up.

The simulator always ends the simulation by printing the its simulation relevant settings and useful
metrics about the simulation as JSON.

```sh
Usage: cellular-automaton-traffic-simulation [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -r, --rounds <ROUNDS>
          The number of rounds to run the simulation for [default: 4096]
  -l, --length <LENGTH>
          The number of cells that make up the road [default: 1000]
  -m, --max-speed <MAX_SPEED>
          The maximum number of cells that a car can drive in a round [default: 5]
      --traffic-density <TRAFFIC_DENSITY>
          The density of traffic. Number of cars on the road are computed as `floor(traffic_density * road_length)` [default: 0.5]
      --dilly-dally-probability <DILLY_DALLY_PROBABILITY>
          The probability with which cars dilly-dally. (slow down randomly) [default: 0.2]
  -v, --verbose
          Whether to print the current road state to stdout
  -i, --image
          Whether to create a visualization image of the simulation
  -o, --out-path <OUT_PATH>
          Where to save the visualization image [default: traffic.png]
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```

Here's an example of what a simulation image looks like:

### Benchmarking

The [python adapter](./benchmarks/adapter.py) provides interfaces and convenience functions that
run the simulator and return the metrics in a pythonic way. The
[plot helper](./benchmarks/plot_helper.py) provides simple utility functions for plotting metrics
using Matplotlib.

Here's an example of a script using both to benchmark what happens to the metrics as the maximum speed increases:

```python
# from: benchmarks/max_speed.py

import numpy as np
from adapter import run_average, SimulationOptions
from plot_helper import plot

VARIABLE = "Max Speed"
SIMULATIONS_EACH = 100

# x-axis
max_speeds = np.arange(0, 9, 1)

# y-axes
average_speeds = []
exit_cell_flows = []
accelerations = []
deaccelerations = []

for max_speed in max_speeds:
    metrics = run_average(SimulationOptions(max_speed=max_speed, traffic_density=0.4, dilly_dally_probability=0.0), SIMULATIONS_EACH)
    average_speeds.append(metrics.average_speed__kilometers_per_hour)
    exit_cell_flows.append(metrics.exit_cell_flow__cars_per_minute)
    accelerations.append(metrics.accelerations)
    deaccelerations.append(metrics.deaccelerations)

plot(VARIABLE, "Average Speed (km/h)", dilly_dally_probabilities, average_speeds)
plot(VARIABLE, "Exit Cell Flow (car/min)", dilly_dally_probabilities, exit_cell_flows)
plot(VARIABLE, "Accelerations (n/car/round)", dilly_dally_probabilities, accelerations)
plot(VARIABLE, "Deaccelerations (n/car/round)", dilly_dally_probabilities, deaccelerations)
```

Here's an example of what a 2D plot looks like:
